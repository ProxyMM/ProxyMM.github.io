<p>The boy narrowly defeated the monster that attacked the girl. The true identity of the monster was similar to "Firestarter", it was a member of a group of villains that had appeared from the book, hijacking people's bodies. The boy finally rescued the girl and the person who had been hijacked, but then foes appeared one after another, and the situation took a turn for the worse!</p>
