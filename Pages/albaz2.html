<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>The Demise of the Great Nation of Dogmatika</em></strong></h1>

<p>Fleudelis hears of Ecclesia's exile and has a foreboding premonition of Maximus and the Dogmatika. Suspecting that Maximus may have ulterior motives, she defects along with Adin and Theo. The three leave the Dogmatika Nation and head toward a distant place where they can have their Stigmata sealed.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/35.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>Concealed within a dense mist at the peak of Mount Swordsoul, the Enion Cradle is a living reservoir of magical water from which the Icejade receive their life force. The Enion Cradle manifests itself in the form of the first Icejade, Kosmochlor, who in turn creates the other Icejade. As they expend their life force, the Icejade's bodies are slowly overtaken by a black color. Upon depleting their energy, the Icejade's spirits return to the Enion Cradle while their bodies shatter into a crystalline material.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/36.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>Fleurdelis, Adin, and Theo arrive at Mount Swordsoul and encounter Chixiao, Mo Ye, and Taia. They are brought to the Enion Cradle and have their Stigmata sealed by the Icejade.</p>

<p>Back at the Dogmatika Nation, Maximus bestows a Stigmata upon a girl with red hair — the 666th Saint.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/38.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>The Day of Gospel</em></strong></h1>

<p>"Maximus" looked up to the firmament in the sacred land of the "Dogmatika Nation". He finally moved towards carrying out his long-desired ritual. It consisted of a forbidden technique to awaken the 'brands' that his countrymen bore, which they happily boasted of as 'stigmata', in order to make dark powers erupt from the opened 'Hole'. As "Maximus" slowly opened his crossed arms, a wave was unleashed from the 'Hole' in the skies that engulfed the entire nation like a massive maw. In a mere instant, the civilians, the soldiers, the entire nation altogether was transfigured into "Despias", actors of tragedy.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/34.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>The 'stigmata' that "Maximus" bestowed upon his countrymen were concealed 'brands' for them to host until the Day of Gospel. The 'brands' engraved in their bodies opened after the ritual, and became 'Holes'.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/39.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>The only thing left clinging to the holy relics were the cursed souls of the Virtuous Vestals. They took a sinister shape as a result of the ritual.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/40.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>


<p>The White Knight — corrupted version of Fleurdelis's previous armor — becomes Quaeritis in the process.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/41.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>


<p>As a result of the ritual, the land known as "Dogmatika" was shattered, and from its foundations a sinister, massive object shaped like a castle surfaced. And so, from the form of "White Knight of Dogmatika" taken by the holy relic, a beautiful yet terrifying monster crept out. Shivering with delight, "Maximus" absorbed the power of darkness onto himself and became "Dramaturge". Finally, the frontlines where "Shuraig" and his allies fought to the death against the 'Knights of Holy Teachings' collapsed under the frenetic attack from the "Despians".</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/42.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>Another figure emerges from the Hole and watches the carnage from afar with amusement. It is Aluber, a masked boy with red hair and pale skin who seems to relish the events unfolding.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/43.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>


<p>Adorned with red orbs identical to Albaz's white orbs, Aluber demonstrates that he, too, has the ability to transform into dragons. He becomes Masquerade the Blazing Dragon and flies off to seek Albaz with motives unknown.</p>

<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>The Fierce Battle at the Great Sand Sea</em></strong></h1>

<p>As a result of the ritual, an unprecedentedly-massive 'Hole' was opened and the energy released from it reached even the distant "Great Sand Sea". Then, the ruler of the "Great Sand Sea" that feeds on 'Holes' and hosts them in its body, "Supreme Sovereign Serpent of Golgonda", rampaged as a result of the influence of this energy. </p>>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/46.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>Furthermore, whether by chance or necessity, the boy caught in the aftereffects of the wave transformed into the red-hot dragon "Albion", engaging in a rampage, dragging in even his allies.</p>

<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>A Reunion to Solve the Predicament: The Intrusion of the Swordsoul Masters
</em></strong></h1>

<p>Amidst the predicament of "Ecclesia", a single thunderclap roared as if tearing the heavens apart, knocking out "Golgonda". The ones appearing in front of the cheering "Springans" were none other than the former Knights of Holy Teachings "Theo" and "Adin", as well as the former virtuous "Fleurdelis". Sensing the secret intentions of "Maximus" and under persistent attacks from the religious disciples that caused them to sustain heavy wounds, they found a method to seal their 'stigmata' and came rushing in to the rescue.</p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/49.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/50.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/51.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>After "Albion" knocked out "Golgonda" and kept rampaging, "Ecclesia" faced him and slowly walked towards him, step by step. There was no trepidation in her heart, only feelings of trust in the boy that stood in front of her. By hearing the name "Ecclesia" gave him being called, "Albaz" regained himself. The many memories obtained through this long journey solidified the bonds between the two of them. He regained consciousness by the power of bonds</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/52.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/53.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>"Fleurdelis" informed them of the crimes of "Maximus", and about returning to their homeland of "Dogmatika" to stop him. On the other hand, "Albaz" and "Ecclesia" learned that the 'stigmata' were cursed 'brands' and resolved to take on a new trip in order to seal the 'brands'. They headed to the sacred summit where the people who helped "Fleurdelis" and the others awaited for them.</p>
<p>The pair takes flight, taking with them the new equipment provided by "Kitt" and the Hammer Rockey containing the feelings of the "Springans".</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/54.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>


<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>The Sacred Land where the Pair Arrived: The Sacred Summit in the Mist
</em></strong></h1>

<p>Leaving behind the "Great Sand Sea", "Ecclesia" rode on the back of "Albaz", who turned into a dragon, and headed towards the direction pointed to them. However, their path was suddenly covered completely by mist. Despite being unable to see what was ahead of them, they continued their flight, until an otherworldly collection of mountains of indescribable beauty appeared.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/55.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>The "Sacred Summit" appearing in front of their eyes is a sacred land where only a few chosen ones are allowed to arrive.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/56.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>As the pair arrived at the "Sacred Summit", they encountered none other than the "Swordsoul Masters": the guardians of the Sacred Summit with the bodies of mythical beasts and carrying shining swords. Their clan inherited a technique that lets them channel a type of energy that only exists in the Great Summit, called "Icejade", into swords by projecting their own 'Souls'.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/57.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>"Albaz" and "Ecclesia" were led in front of the leader of the "Swordsoul Masters", "Swordsoul Supreme Sovereign - Chengying", who judged their true nature using the 'Swordsoul Horn' of "Swordsoul Auspice Chunjun", which can discern good from evil, and then granted them entry to the mysterious depths of the Sacred Summit.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/58.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>After earning the permission from "Chengying", the pair heads towards the the center area, and as they reach the deepest part of the summit, a breathtakingly beautiful world of ice and water appeared before their eyes: the motherly "Enion Cradle". What was hidden at the bottom of these waters was none other than the source of "Icejade" energy of this land, which produces the mist that hides the "Sacred Summit" from the outside world.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/35.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>"Enion Cradle" gave birth to its own small manifestation, "Kosmochlor", who in turn gave birth to the "Icejade" spirits. Furthermore, the "Swordsoul Masters" receive the power of the "Icejade" from "Kosmochlor", turn it into swords, and protect the Sacred Summit. This is how the "Enion Cradle" has been protected from the outside world for ages.</p>
<p>"Icejade Kosmochlor"
    The affectionate mother of all the "Icejades" and the being that grants power to the "Swordsoul Masters". However, such role has lasted for too long, and it seems that her power is finally exhausting. <br> "Icejade Aegirine"
    A manifestation that was born as the "Icejade Empress" of this era. She has a reserved and shy personality, but she loves the "Icejade" land and her friends from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/60.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>The "Icejades" and "Swordsoul Masters" detected from afar a power that threatened the Sacred Summit, that's why they decided to welcome "Ecclesia" and the other outsiders as a key to face this threat. Thanks to the protection of the "Icejades", their 'stigmata' were temporarily prevented from turning into 'brands'. However, the "Despias" sneered at that and began their nefarious plan.</p>

<P>Meanwhile Ad Libitum secretly emerges from a Hole and offers Longyuan a deal.</P>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/61.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>
<p>"Longyuan" hides his dark desires to rule the Sacred Summit through death and raw power, instead of fulfilling his role as its protector. He falsified his own 'Soul' by splitting the black "Swordsoul" channeled from his heart in two, then passing one of them as the sword of "Mo Ye", an apprentice with a particular ancestry.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/59.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>



<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>The Invasion of Evil: The Unexpected Encounter of the Disciples
</em></strong></h1>

<p>"Dramaturge", whose power surpassed that of the "Enion Cradle" as a result of the awakening of the 'brands', discovered the hidden Sacred Summit and sent in the "Despia" forces. At the same time, "Longyuan" stole the "Swordsoul" from "Mo Ye" and attacked the "Enion Cradle".</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/62.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>Unifying both swords, he revealed his true character in the form of "Qixing Longyuan" and tried to take the life of "Kosmochlor". "Chengying" rushed into the fight, and together with "Kingfisher", a guardian beast born from "Kosmochlor", began an intense fight against "Qixing Longyuan".</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/63.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>"Icejade Creation Kingfisher"
    A guardian beast born from using the remaining power of "Kosmochlor".</p>
    <p><img src="../Images/Albaz/64.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>As a result of the rebellion of "Longyuan" and the attack from the "Despias", the Sacred Summit faced its ultimate crisis. Taking advantage of the chaos, the young boy "Aluber", who emitted an aura exactly like that of "Albaz" even while wearing a mask, appeared in front of "Albaz" and "Ecclesia". She perceived an extraordinary presence, but in order to save the "Icejades" that granted them a favor, they made every effort along with the "Swordsoul Masters" to stop the violent attack of the "Despias".</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/65.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>"Aluber", who freely controlled the power of the 'Hole', bound down "Albaz", stole his power to turn into a dragon and turned into "Lubellion", a dragon with the power of ancient, divine flames. Then he attacked "Chengying" and "Kosmochlor", who were fighting "Qixing Longyuan", and burnt them to ashes.</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/66.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>Despite losing his power to turn into a dragon, "Albaz" refused to give up. Sensing this, "Kosmochlor" and "Chengying" unleashed the last remains of their powers to awaken the "Swordsoul" power in "Albaz". "Albaz" transformed into "Mirrorjade", a dragon of swords that wields both ice and fire, and with its countless iceblades he repelled "Qixing Longyuan".</p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/68.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>
<p><img src="../Images/Albaz/67.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>"Mirrorjade" and "Lubellion" clashed with each other, unleashing opposite powers. As a result of this clash, a dreadful force field appeared, unifying both dragons as they fought. Then, a single mass like a sun rose from the bottom of "Enion Cradle" and floated out the Sacred Summit to the distant skies, and from inside of it, one new dragon appeared.</p>
