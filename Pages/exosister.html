<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>Spirits Spreading in 
        Our World</em></strong></h1>

<p>A long time ago, the demons spreading in the world were 
        slain by envoys of the heavens at the end of the Great War.
        However, these evil souls were able to prolong their 
        existence by possessing lifeforms, and after the passage of
        time, completed their resurrection. Thus, as a result 
        of the power of the reborn demons, humankind was on its
        way to its decline... lamenting the condition of humanity, 
        the girls in each sanctuary collectively offered
        their prayers. The heavens took heed of their prayers 
        and delivered salvation: the girls were granted divine
        tools in the form of necklaces that hold the power of
         the envoys of heaven, which embody the will of the gods
        and that transform into weapons through their prayers.
         The holy water that is unleashed takes the form of the
        symbol of salvation and envelops the girls. People have
         come to fondly call the girls that wield the sacred arms
        and that exterminate the evil spirits through the miracles
         of the grace of the heavens "Exosisters". The
        remaining survivors created organizations centered around 
        the "Exosisters". Treading between life and death,
        they began their counterattack.

<p>Demons can possess various lifeforms in order to gain a 
        temporary body. There have been sightings of humans being
        possessed by demons, but it's possible to prevent
         this by wearing a charm against evil spirits. There are two
        main ways to exterminate demons: the first one is 
        to recite their true name and extract their souls. The second
        one is by destroying the possessing soul lying at 
        the very depths of the possessed target through force. Since
        this second method can prove difficult if the demon is 
        strong enough, it has become imperative to elucidate
        their true names.

<p>The "Exosisters" have resolved to act in pairs to avoid losing the power of hope, however, in territories where the fight becomes too stern, these pairs form teams. Furthermore, sisters that have exchanged vows of sisterhood are able to unleash a particularly strong power, with sisters "Elis" & "Stella" and sisters "Irene" & "Sophia" being granted power from the superior envoys and forming team 'Lilium', who are assigned to territories where particularly-powerful demons lurk. After the results of countless battles and with the help of the resistance organizations of this territory, they managed to protect people from the hands of the demons, however, the darkness of the lurking demons grows deeper by the hour.</p>

<p>"Exosister Elis"
        The leader of 'Lilium'. She had an elder sister with whom she exchanged the vows of sisterhood, however her whereabouts became unknown during the midst of a battle.</p>
