<p>It is there that an ancient and giant
    interdimensional gate connecting to
    the abyss appears, known as 'Hole'.It is an ancient
    and massive gate to another dimension that
    occasionally appears. It can bring both
    disaster and blessings, like weapons or
    energy. People fight over its resources
    to survive.</p>

<p>Over the years, this has resulted in these
    residents aligning themselves with their own tribes
    or species, creating more and more nations and
    organizations, in a constant state of turmoil.</p>

    </summary>
    <p>The "Tri-Brigade" launched a rescue mission to
        liberate their imprisoned allies from battles
        past. They breached the holy land of "Dogmatika",
        but the 'Hole' unleashed a powerful dragon.
        "Fleurdelis" swiftly defeated the dragon, yet
        a wounded youth was left behind where the
        creature vanished.</p>

    <p><img src="../../Images/Albaz/11.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>

    <p>A black-cloaked boy who appeared after
        the dragon vanished. Upon witnessing
        his deep wounds and apparent lack of
        memories, the "Tri-Brigade" were reminded
        of their own past, and they decided to protect him.</p>

    <p><img src="../../Images/Albaz/12.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>


    <p>Acting out of pure compassion, Ecclesia shielded
        the boy, an act which caused her to be
        denounced as a heretic who went against doctrine.</p>


    <p><img src="../../Images/Albaz/13.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>

    <p>Ashiyan lashes out at Ecclesia and conjures
        a Hole that causes her to clutch at her Stigmata,
        apparently in great pain. The boy reacts by transforming
        into another dragon — Brigrand the Glory Dragon — and
        repels Ashiyan while protecting the unconscious Ecclesia.
        The Tri-Brigade also jumps into action, using the
        opportunity to extradite both her and the boy from
        the Dogmatika Nation.</p>

    </summary>
    <p>Gaining the protection of "Tri-Brigade", the boy and girl managed 
        to escape their dire situation. Warning them
        that there will be pursuers on their trail soon, "Shuraig" told
         the two of them they need to quickly leave the
        "Tri-Brigade" stronghold. On this unfamiliar journey, the two of
         them began to develop a bond ever so clumsily,
        eventually arriving at the "Great Sand Sea" and meeting the 
        "Springans"</p>


    <p><img src="../../Images/Albaz/16.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>

    <p>
        In a cruel twist of fate, the boy and girl had nowhere to go. 
        Seeing the two of them reminded "Shuraig" and the
        others of their own past, when they were chased out by their
         own tribes and were on the verge of death. With no
        memories and incapable of trusting even himself, the young boy 
        saw how the people before him treated even
        "Ecclesia", who was supposed to be their enemy, with kindness. 
        And so, he developed his first sense of trust.
        Afterward, "Shuraig" entrusted the Mecha Shrike to the boy as 
        proof of his identity.</p>
