<p>The fairies fly all over the world, granting "Corollas" to the animals that give them a hand with the arrival of spring. The animals that have received these "Corollas" become able to speak and walk on two legs through some mysterious power.</p>

<p>Thanks to the hard work of the fairies and the animals, the forest recovers its colors and a warm wind envelops the world. Finally, with the awakening of the "Goddess", the arrival of spring is complete.</p>
