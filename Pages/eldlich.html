                        to its Owner, "Eldlixir"</em></strong></h1>

<p>In times past, sages possessed by greed offered thousands of 
        souls to the magic stone "Eldlixir", until it finally
        awakened. Shining a bright crimson, it then transformed 
        the land its light touched upon into a golden city, the
        very picture of wealth. But all life within it was reduced 
        to shambling undead.

<p>The legend of that city ruled by gold and undeath became known 
        around the world as "Eldland, the Golden Land". Those
        greedy enough to search it out provided a constant source
         of fuel for the magic stone's ever-growing power.

<p>The stone that had led countless travelers to their doom ultimately 
        found itself in the hands of one inhumanly
        strong-willed man. And so, "Eldlich the Golden Lord", a being 
        unparalleled in his greed, and immortal ruler of
        the "Golden Land", was born.</p>

<p>The target of his desire wasn't limited to just the "Golden Land",
         it also extended to the outside world. "Eldlich"
        performed a ritual that focused the golden curse on himself, 
        which raised the curtain on his march to conquer
        the world itself.</p>

<p>The merciless curse of the magic stone made no distinctions on who 
        or what it ensnared. Gold-hungry travelers, armies
        from beyond the sea in search of new lands to conquer, and the 
        native beasts of the bewitched city were all
        transformed into deathless gold.</p>
