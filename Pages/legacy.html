<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>The Endlessly Repeating Tale of the Rise and Fall of a Certain World</em></strong></h1>

<p>The boys and girl, who barely eked out an existence in a time of harshness and cruelty, followed the path of destiny across the world, and eventually became embroiled in a great battle that decided the fate of the entire planet... let us introduce the tale of that distant star, where people's dreams and desires mix, all circling around a 'Key' that was left behind by God.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: rgb(119, 115, 115);"><strong>The Creation Myth Passed Down by the Celestial Forest</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: rgb(119, 115, 115);">In days of long ago, there was a God who governed the movements of the heavens.<br>
    That God used the dragons as its vassals,<br>
    To fulfill their duty of maintaining the heavens in a cycle of creation and destruction.<br>
    However, the power of destruction grew each time it was used,<br>
    And eventually, the balance of power between creation and destruction had collapsed.<br>
    The power of destruction had become so great,<br>
    That if it was let loose, it would have certainly destroyed the very heavens it was created to protect.<br>
    God decided it was impossible to govern the heavens by themselves.<br>
    Using the power of creation, a cage was forged, made of countless layers of the earthen crust,<br>
    And the power of destruction was sealed within.<br>
    The power of destruction, having lost its way, burned up, transforming into the planet's core.<br>
    Its energy blended together with the power of creation coursing throughout the land,<br>
    And the energy that flowed forth to the surface of the earth,<br>
    Giving rise to life, small existences that repeat the cycle of life and death.<br>
    God turned the last vestiges of their being into a 'Key',<br>
    Entrusting it to the life that had sprouted across the earth, and disappeared.<br>
    Over the countless years to follow, the power of destruction sometimes manifested itself on the surface,<br>
    But each time, those small lives stood side-by-side with the dragons.<br>
    In time, the 'Key' came to be known as a sword, while the power of destruction came to be known as the 'Great Darkness',<br>
    And their story was passed down as the gallant epic of the 'World Hero'.<br>
    <br><br>
    "Starlight Hero, Raise Your Sword and Gather the Light, You Must Vanquish the Great Darkness"</p>


    <h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>The People who Lived in the Celestial Forest</em></strong></h1>
<p>There was a hidden village of humans in the great verdant forest known as the 'Celestial Forest'. This village, which worshipped the God of the Stars, had a sacred staff used in their rites and customs that had been passed down through countless generations, creating a barrier that protected the village from threats with its power. The successor of the staff at the time was "Ib", who had an older brother, "Ningirsu", and together the two of them spent time with their childhood friend, the young boy "Auram", and the small dragon whelp "Imduk".</p>
