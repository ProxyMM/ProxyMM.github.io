<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>"Sinful Spoils": A Tale of Temptation and Tragedy</em></strong></h1>

<p>"Sinful Spoils of Subversion - Snake Eye" embodies the very disaster
    of this world, an inescapable absurdity. It employs all means to stir 
   people's desires and discard their souls, reducing them to mere puppets. </p>

<p>
    For those seeking only obedient tools, souls tainted by sin are superfluous. 
    In this paradoxical world, both the taker and the taken coexist equally. Thus 
    begins the battle to strip everything from the girl who has already lost everything.</p>

<p> Faced with abandonment and bearing the weight of the world's sins, she confronts 
    the birth of a cursed "treasure" that brings various calamities. Its pitiful guise mirrors 
    that of a lost soul wandering through eternal time.</p>

<p>In the depths of an underground mall bar, whispers spread:</br>
    -"Have you heard of her? The one rumored to hunt Sin Treasures?"</br>
    -"Huh? Who?"</br>
    -"She's a treasure hunter specializing in cursed relics."</br>
    -"It's just a rumor. She deals with Sin Treasures too?"</br>
    -"People who've seen her swear it's true."</br>
    -"Just a myth..."</br>
    -"Wait, ever seen a Family Treasure?"</br>
    -"No, it's not that eerie. Oh, remember the building in Mukaihigashi?"</br>
    -"Strange. Someone met her gaze... Oh, leaving so soon?"</br>
    She was a grim figure.</br>
    -"Sin Treasure Hunter" Black Witch Dear Bellstar<br><br>

    A treasure hunter draped in black, wielding potent magic, she's dubbed a
    "devil" for her ruthless tactics in securing her bounty. Her abilities surpass 
   those of ordinary humans, fueled by mysterious magic. Her enigmatic past 
   shrouded in secrecy, she's known simply as the "Treasure Hunting Demon."</p>

<P>Guided by scant information on the Sinful Spoils, she journeys southeast
    from the underground mall, stumbling upon a crumbling ruin. Once a
    majestic temple, it now stands forlorn, corrupted by the sudden appearance 
   of the Sinful Spoils "Snake Eye." </P>

<p>Clearing the one-eyed monsters that infest
    the area, she finally reaches the trail's end, where a colossal eye gleams red. The
     witch locks gazes with the peculiar creature â€“ a signal for the hunt to commence.
     Suddenly, from the azure flames, a massive dragon materializes, roaring with
     delight at its long-awaited prey.</p>

    <p>Once the guardian deity of
        this land, a giant dragon born from a sealed treasure now reigns
        over the Snake Eye Temple. Its ferocity surpasses its former self, 
        spawning new creatures from the blue flames that emanate from its 
        body. Those who meet its gaze find themselves paralyzed, unable to
         move. The Fire Dragon and its affiliates now nest within the temple, 
        under its dominion.</p>
     <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/5.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>The Sinful Spoils possesssed by the Black Witch help her deal with the relentless 
    onslaught of the giant dragon and its affiliates. Eventually,
     she manages to quell the raging blue flames of the Fire Dragon</p>

     <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/9.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>

     <p>Believing victory is at hand, the Black Witch moves to claim
        the Sinful Spoil, only to witness countless cracks shatter its facade...</p>
        <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/10.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>


<p>A mysterious entity is born from the "Original Sinful Spoil"
    Diabellstar is bewildered by this unexpected turn, yet she 
   claims it as a "treasure." Lately, she's noticed magical items 
   disappearing around her. Perhaps it's just her imagination,
    but she struggles to sleep well...</p>
    <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/11.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>


<p>After retrieving Poplar that 
    emerged from the Sinful Spoil, Diabellstar returns to the
     underground city where she's based. </p>
     <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/12.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>Just as she plans to research 
    Poplar and rest briefly before seeking the next Sinful Spoil,
     a sudden explosion echoes, and numerous headlights pierce the darkness.</p>
     <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/13.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>A motley crew of little demons, hailing from diverse backgrounds, 
    rally around Gabonga, leader of an outlaw gang with their base next 
    to a towering structure in the underground mall. They laboriously tame
     the roaming monsters of the area, fashioning them into customized 
    vehicles each day! Driven primarily by profit, they've repeatedly clashed
     with bounty hunter Diabellstar, only to suffer resounding defeats... 
    Realizing their inability to best Diabellstar, they now risk life and limb 
    to pilfer the treasures she procures. Under the blood code known as the 
    "Great Iron Rule of Goblin Bikers" they persistently rev the engines of their souls...</p>

<p>-"Hey, Black Witch! We've been waiting for you!"<br>
    -"It's you guys again..."<br>
    Thus, the battle commences.<br>
    -"That little kid the Black Witch is carrying looks like the Sinful Spoil on
     the wanted poster!" <br><br>
    The goblins, eyeing the mysterious creature, manage 
    to seize Poplar, who slumbers peacefully through the chaos. 
    Meanwhile, the diversionary force engages the Black Witch.
    However, their jubilation is short-lived. With a devilish expression, the 
    Black Witch smashes their comrades, their smiles contorting into fear.</p>
    <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/14.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>Sensing impending danger, leader Gabonga takes a risk.
    He unleashes the shackles of the "Hundred Demons' Great
    Beast," a fearsome demonic creature sealed within a warehouse
    at the wharf, and previously deemed unrideable even after capture. 
   The colossal beast, rampaging indiscriminately, appears to have absorbed potent magical energy.</p>

   <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/16.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>


<p>Amidst the chaos, Poplar who had been dozing, awakens.
    Awoken and famished, Poplar drawn to the magical essence of the 
    "Sinful Spoils" challenges the formidable Great Beast to a battle of eat 
    or be eaten! Despite the vast difference in size, Poplar consumes the Great
     Beast whole. But something feels amiss...!? 
    </p>
    <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/19.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>
    <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/17.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>


<p>Suddenly, Poplar transformsa!!! Diabellstar swiftly restrains the frenzied Great
    Poplar and, unexpectedly, hurls it toward Gabonga and his cohorts with a mighty
    swing!!
   </p>
   <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/18.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>
  
<p>Diabelstar gazes blankly as the "Goblin Bikers" scatter and ignite, uttering their final words.
    The sudden appearance of a white shadow leaves Diabelstar with no chance. 
    It seals the magical power of the Great Flame Demon.</p>
    <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/20.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>
    <p><img src="../../Images/Diabell/22.jpg" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 90%; height: auto;"></p>
  
<p>There's no mistaking that figure or that magical prowess.
    Another witch emerges onto the scene.
    "Skillfully manipulating the power of the Sinful Spoils, she
     steals the Flame Scale. Then, she lures Diabelstar into a deep 
    sleep. As the hands of the stopped clock start to move again, the
    Sinful Spoil spins. It's the Sinful Spoil of Slumber - Morrian"</p>
