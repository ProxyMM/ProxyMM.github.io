Anger was trying to resist but in his 
     weakened state he had no way to stop it. 
    He realized that there was no point in resisting.
    Visas asks "fear," "sorrow," and "joy"...
     Why do you want to become "Visas"? In response,
     "anger" answers that it is impossible for you to defeat "him." 
    Who exactly is he referring to...
    "I have defeated him, so I will not allow him to be defeated again." 
    "If I lose, I will fight as Visas next time," he declared, and
     "anger" returned to Visas. Although he had doubts,
     he accepted those words and regained his sense of self.

After recovering from his injuries, 
Visas turns his attention from the spiritual world to reality 
and rebuilds the world he has damaged. In the past, 
a beautiful "Calarium" stood there. His desire to create
 a world where all people could coexist formed a large water planet,
 "Amritara." He named it and headed for the water planet.

 He was at the center of a world where the nature of "Reichphobia," 
the water of "Perlereino," and the machines of "Wraitsoth" 
were mixed together. Then, Visas landed in front of it 
and was greeted by representatives of the three races,
 Scarecrow, Tiaraments, and Kshatrila. They recognized
 him as the new king, having become one with their master. 
The conflict had ended, but he had not yet traveled to all the worlds, and the 
words of "Wrath" were also a cause for concern. Visas decided to set off on a 
journey to a new world.


In an unknown parallel dimension, a man witnessed Visas's battle from beginning 
to end. His name is "Veda," and he wants to know everything. He follows Visas'
 movements for an endless long time, reflecting on events that even Visas would 
not know about. Starting from nothingness, sometimes he is scared, sometimes he 
is sad and lamenting, sometimes he is angry, sometimes he is happy and excited.
Green, blue, red, yellow... each color develops differently, and the water he absorbs 
also changes in various ways. Even though he split it with his own hands, he never
 expected it to turn out like this. He has finally reached this far. He wants to try out
 that power once. With the birth of the Water Planet, the man finally takes action.

Veda first attacked the great tree of "Kararium." A brilliant light was emitted from 
Veda, and the land of "Amritara" collapsed in an instant along with the great tree. 
Without hiding the fact that what they had regained was lost in an instant, Visas and 
his friends went into battle. The evolved Visas swung his great sword, followed by
 the mermaid "Trilosucuta," who had evolved with the power of the three races. The
 battle between Visas and Veda became more and more intense as time passed, and 
there was even a risk that the water planet would be destroyed if it continued like 
this...

Visas decides to move the battlefield to space to protect the planet. First, however,
 the intensity of the battle continues to grow, and Visas's great sword and Veda's 
trident collide, creating shock waves that could shatter other planets with each
 blow. Veda, who realizes Visas' growth, smiles fearlessly, but Visas cannot
 understand his intentions. In the midst of a seemingly endless battle, Veda 
activates one of his secret techniques. --And with this technique, which he has
 activated many times, Visas becomes an innocent nova again... A Rebirth.

Although there is no trace of his earthen fist, his strong eyes shoot into the sky, 
and he holds a slender sword in his hand... While some things have changed, some 
things remain the same. With a part of the feelings he has cultivated up until now
 in his heart, Visas advances through a desolate planet that seems somehow familiar. 
Awaiting him up ahead is the King of "Terror." The two meet again, and as they exchange
 glances, the king breathes, "Visas has woken up again, but his appearance is different 
from before. I wonder if I once swung my sword." To what extent does he understand 
the meaning of "again?" Even the two of them do not know. Now they simply exchange
 swords. In the midst of the battle, the king recalls memories he no longer remembers.
 The feel of the fist he once swung... his hollow eyes, his small self. It was only for an instant, 
but it was enough time to decide the battle. Even though he changed his weapon, he lost again...
 "Again?" No, I was the one who taught him this technique in the first place. 
Visas held out his hand to the king as he muttered. This time, the two of them
 would fight together. The fear he once felt was no longer there. On the contrary, 
he felt refreshed. The king was surprised at himself and replied to the outstretched hand,
 "That's not bad."
