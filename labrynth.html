<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>The Enormous Silver Castle</em></strong></h1>

<p>According to legend and rumor, this castle was cursed, and the
        curse of the labyrinth would never
        be broken unless the true treasure lying deep within
        the castle was brought back.
</p>
<p>But according to others, the master of the castle was an
        immensely gorgeous
        princess, who was delicate as a white thread, and ephemeral
        as the moon.
</p>
<p>That night, a knight stepped foot into this castle
        swarming with rumors...</p>

        esteemed knight is coming!! Quickly, get into position!
        Archfiend! I told you, you've got Grand Gallery duty tonight!»</p>
<p style="color: rgb(37, 199, 145);">«Chandraglier, it is not time to sleep.»</p>

<p style="color: rgb(255, 107, 132);">«Phew, barely made it! ...I
        mean a-ahem! WELCOME, DEAR KNIGHT! Tonight, the staff of the
        Silver Castle of Labrynth are pleased to present you with the
        utmost courtesy and respectful hospitality.»</p>
<p style="color: rgb(37, 199, 145);">«Come in, please enjoy

<p style="color: rgb(255, 107, 132);">«First, let us begin
        with the Reception Hall! It includes a collection of
        furnishings that Her Highness the Princess has elegantly
        and elaborately decorated. It is the result of roughly
        three days' worth of burning the midnight oil.»</p>
<p style="color: rgb(37, 199, 145);">«They shall come at you
        from every direction, from every nook and cranny, so please,
        enjoy the blood-thirsty, diabolic interior of the castle to
        your heart's content.»</p>

<p style="color: rgb(255, 107, 132);">«Now, let's see how far has
        that knight gotten by no— hey, that was quick! In front of the staircase
        already! Augh, we worked soooo hard to prepare!»</p>
<p style="color: rgb(37, 199, 145);">«Didn't even take the time to
        appreciate it. I wonder what I should tell Her Highness the Princess
        when she inquires as usual about how much our dear knight enjoyed and
        suffered. Though, our middle elder sister will scold us later for how
        quickly this was.»</p>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 107, 132);">«At least, it's time for the
        two of us to have some fun.»</p>

        a chance to inflict some suffering.»</p>

        quickly you have arrived! But to move forward, thou shalt face
        us, the younger sisters of the Ariadne white porcelain maidens:
        Ariane, and...!»</p>
<p style="color: rgb(37, 199, 145);">«...Arianna, for we shall be
        your opponents.»</p>
<p>Several hours later...</p>
<p style="color:rgb(37, 199, 145);">«Phew, got away in the end. I
        doubt I will be able to move for some time.»</p>
<p>(Chandraglier gurgles and Stovie Torbie whines)</p>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 107, 132);">«Oh my, you guys did a great
        job too. But, I wonder if Her Highness the Princess will be satisfied
        with this. It probabyl has to do with her being stuck indoor all
        this time, but she seems awfully excited today.»</p>
<p>(Cuckoo creaks and one of the lamps hisses)</p>
<p style="color:rgb(37, 199, 145);">«It is fine, our noble middle
        older sisters are still waiting in the Grand Garden. Besides, I
        am sure our dear knight will not be able to find it tonight either.
        The true treasure remains trapped within this castle... hrm, what
        is it, Archfiend?»</p>
<p>(Archfiend rumbles)</p>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 107, 132);">«Hey, you're supposed to be
        in the Grand Gallery! If someone goes through there, they end
        up right in Her Highness' rooms, you know?»</p>

        not wait'?»</p>
<p style="color: rgb(255, 107, 132);">«'She just rushed out and
        disappeared'!? IT'S S-S-SERIOUS!! With the castle being full
        of traps, it's absolutely not safe!!»</p>
