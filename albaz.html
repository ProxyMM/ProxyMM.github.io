            the Outside World</em></strong></h1>

<p>It is there that an ancient and giant 
    interdimensional gate connecting to 
    the abyss appears, known as 'Hole'.It is an ancient 
    and massive gate to another dimension that 
    occasionally appears. It can bring both
     disaster and blessings, like weapons or
      energy. People fight over its resources
       to survive.</p>

<p>Over the years, this has resulted in these
    residents aligning themselves with their own tribes
    or species, creating more and more nations and
    organizations, in a constant state of turmoil.</p>

<h1 class="story-title-2">Inhabitants of the Closed-Off Land: Tri-Brigade</h1>

<p>Beastmen tribes, once united,
     split due to conflicts over resources.
      Outcast youths, including 'The Featherless,' 
      'The Thieving Cat,' and 'The Fratricider,'
       formed a bond in exile. They gathered allies
        to fight the invading Dogmatika. Witnessing 
        their unity, tribes put aside differences to 
        unite against the invaders. A stoic general led 
        the charge, inspiring with the might of war beasts.
</p>

<p>
    The Volunteer Army, led by the "First Three," is a group formed
    to combat a common enemy, composed of exiled or shunned
    tribe members. They equip themselves with steel armaments
    to counter the holy tools of the enemy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>"Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen":</strong> Mockingly called
        featherless, he leads the "Tri-Brigade" with few words but
        relentless courage in battle, especially against the daring
        "Fleurdelis."<br>
   <strong>"Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller":</strong> Once a slayer of his
        own kind, he now serves as the Assault Captain, leading ground
        forces and ensuring safety in retreats.<br>
    <strong>"Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom" and "Tri-Brigade Kitt":</strong>
        Ferrijit, spurned as a thieving cat, leads ground forces alongside
        her younger sister Kitt, known for her eye-catching appearance and
        dance-like battle style, earning her the nickname "Barren Blossom."

<p>Seeking a new life, they left their homeland in
     search of a fresh ideal. Their journey led them 
     to the "Great Golgonda Desert," where they encountered 
     vast skies, endless sands, and a colossal monster.
      Wherever this creature roamed, the mysterious 'Hole' 
      appeared frequently, releasing treasures and strange
       tools. Determined to surpass their past, the "Springans"
        embraced challenges to burn brighter. They merged with 
        unearthed machines, filling each day with the sounds of
         clangs and explosions.</p>

<h2 class="story-title-2">The Youth who Appeared in the Midst of the "Dogmatika"-"Tri-Brigade" Battle</h2>

<p>The "Tri-Brigade" decided to initiate a
     prisoner-of-war rescue operation to free their 
     comrades who had been captured in the battles 
     up until that point. They succeeded in invading 
     the holy land of "Dogmatika", but inexplicably,
      the 'Hole' opened up, releasing a dragon with 
      horrifying powers. "Fleurdelis" managed to strike
       down the dragon with a single blow, but a wounded
        youth remained where the dragon disappeared...</p>

<p>A black-cloaked boy who appeared after 
    the dragon vanished. Upon witnessing 
    his deep wounds and apparent lack of 
    memories, the "Tri-Brigade" were reminded 
    of their own past, and they decided to protect him.</p>

<p>Acting out of pure compassion, she shielded
     the boy, an act which caused her to be 
     denounced as a heretic who went against doctrine.</p>

     <p>Ashiyan lashes out at Ecclesia and conjures
         a Hole that causes her to clutch at her Stigmata, 
         apparently in great pain. The boy reacts by transforming
         into another dragon — Brigrand the Glory Dragon — and 
         repels Ashiyan while protecting the unconscious Ecclesia.
          The Tri-Brigade also jumps into action, using the
           opportunity to extradite both her and the boy from 
           the Dogmatika Nation.</p>
