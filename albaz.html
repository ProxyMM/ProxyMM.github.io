<h1 class="story-title"><strong><em>A Continent Isolated from
            the Outside World</em></strong></h1>

<p>It is there that an ancient and giant interdimensional
    gate connecting to the abyss appears, known as 'Hole'.
    At times, it appears as a calamity that swallows up land
    and people, but other times as a godsend that bestows
    unknown weapons, relics, or crystalized energy. Those
    living on that land fight over the limited resources,
    either protecting their own or taking them from others
    . </p>

<p>Over the years, this has resulted in these
    residents aligning themselves with their own tribes
    or species, creating more and more nations and
    organizations, in a constant state of turmoil.</p>

<h2 class="story-title">Inhabitants of the Closed-Off Land: Tri-Brigade</h2>

<p>Beastmen tribes, once united by bravery and honor,
    became divided by conflict over food and
    territory, leading to animosity. Young outcasts,
    including 'The Featherless,' 'The Thieving Cat,'
    and 'The Fratricider,' formed a bond amidst their
    exile. Together, they gathered allies to
    confront the invading Dogmatika. Witnessing
    their unity and selflessness, tribes set
    aside hatred to form a powerful union against
    the invaders. A quiet yet heroic general leads
    the charge, inspiring all with the roar of the
    battlefield's iron beasts.
</p>

<p>
    The Volunteer Army, led by the "First Three," is a group formed
    to combat a common enemy, composed of exiled or shunned
    tribe members. They equip themselves with steel armaments
    to counter the holy tools of the enemy.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>"Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen":</strong> Mockingly called
        featherless, he leads the "Tri-Brigade" with few words but
        relentless courage in battle, especially against the daring
        "Fleurdelis."</li>
    <li><strong>"Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller":</strong> Once a slayer of his
        own kind, he now serves as the Assault Captain, leading ground
        forces and ensuring safety in retreats.</li>
    <li><strong>"Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom" and "Tri-Brigade Kitt":</strong>
        Ferrijit, spurned as a thieving cat, leads ground forces alongside
        her younger sister Kitt, known for her eye-catching appearance and
        dance-like battle style, earning her the nickname "Barren Blossom."</li>

    in the Dogmatika Nation, empowered by holy stigmata
    and tasked with enforcing the 666 commandments of
    their scriptures. These stigmata grant special powers,
    referred to as miracles, which are used to combat

        and open-mindedness have won her widespread
        admiration.</li>
    <li><strong>"Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted":</strong>
        Possesses holy stigmas on her limbs,
        granting immense physical strength and
        thunderstrike power. Protects both the
        nation and "Ecclesia" with these abilities
        and three holy relics.</li>
    <li><strong>"Dogmatika Maximus":</strong>
        The supreme leader of "Dogmatika," bestows divine blessings
        of holy stigma using the divine sculpture "Nexus"
        before granting citizenship.</li>
    <li><strong>"Dogmatika Adin, the Enlightened":</strong>
        Belongs to the support company of the 'Knights of Holy
        Teachings,' providing assistance through miraculous powers.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>"Dogmatika Theo, the Iron Punch":</strong>
    Member of the close-quarters battle company under
    "Fleurdelis," wields an iron hammer with the ability
