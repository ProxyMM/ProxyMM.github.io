                the Outside World</em></strong></h1>
    
            <p>It is there that an ancient and giant interdimensional
                 gate connecting to the abyss appears, known as 'Hole'. 
                 At times, it appears as a calamity that swallows up land
                  and people, but other times as a godsend that bestows
                   unknown weapons, relics, or crystalized energy. Those 
                   living on that land fight over the limited resources,
                    either protecting their own or taking them from others
                    . <br> Over the years, this has resulted in these 
                    residents aligning themselves with their own tribes
                     or species, creating more and more nations and 
                     organizations, in a constant state of turmoil.</p>

            <h2 class="story-title">Inhabitants of the Closed-Off Land: Tri-Brigade</h2>

            <p>Since time immemorial, there have been many tribes of
                 beastmen scattered throughout the land. Although they 
                 shared similarities in their bravery and honor, the
                  battles over the scarce food and territory led to a 
                  cycle of hatred among the tribes.
                'The Featherless', 'The Thieving Cat', 'The Fratricider'
                In the midst of this, young children were expelled from 
                their own tribes due to unfortunate circumstances. What 
                awaited each of them should have been death, but instead 
                they miraculously encountered each other, and created a 
                bond that transcended tribes. The First Three eventually
                 gathered more comrades, and created a force large enough 
                 to be called a herd.
                Although the group found peace in a distant country of 
                iron, news of the invading "Dogmatika", a superpower to 
                the far north, made its way to them. Having forgiven what
                 had happened in the past and acknowledging the importance
                  of bonds, the group decided to take a stand. After picking 
                  up allies along the way, they arrived back at their homelands
                  . Upon witnessing the "Dogmatika" assault and the tribes'
                   resistance, the group proposed an alliance to fight back.
                    The forms of the selfless group fighting fiercely on the
                     front lines moved the hearts of all who witnessed it, 
                     and the tribes finally overcame their hatred for each 
                     other, prompting the creation of a giant union. At the
                      forefront of these battles, the figure of the quiet 
                      and stoic general can be seen heroically battling on. 
                      Invaders, hear the roar of the battlefield's iron beasts!</p>

<p>The Volunteer Army with the "First Three" at its Center
    A militarized organization created with the goal of
     defeating a common enemy, it is composed of those 
     who were exiled or shunned by their tribes. To match
      the miraculous powers of the holy tools used by the 
      'Knights of Holy Teachings', they equip themselves 
      with steel armaments that fire concentrated energy.</p>

<p>"Tri-Brigade Shuraig the Ominous Omen"
    A young man once mockingly called featherless, he 
    is the leader of the "Tri-Brigade". A man of few 
    words, but he has stood up to the daring "Fleurdelis"
     in battle countless times.</p>

<p>"Tri-Brigade Rugal the Silver Sheller"
    Once a slayer of his own brethren, he calls himself the
     Assault Captain. While Shuraig's main battlefield is the
      skies, his is the land. He not only rallies the troops,
       but also ensures he's the rearguard in any retreat.</p>

<p>"Tri-Brigade Ferrijit the Barren Blossom" and "Tri-Brigade 
    Kitt" Spurned as a thieving cat since young, "Ferrijit" was 
    eventually chased out of her tribe together with her younger 
    sister "Kitt". Like "Rugal", she leads the ground forces with
     her big-sister-like dependability. Her eye-catching appearance
      and dance-like battle style has earned her the nickname "Barren 
      Blossom" from even her enemies.</p>

<h2 class="story-title">Inhabitants of the Closed-Off Land: Dogmatika</h2>
    
<p>Those who have been called into the Glorious Knights of Holy Teachings,
     carve the 666 commandments of the holy scriptures
     into your soul, and recite them once a day under the sun.
    "Dogmatika Nation" is a land beloved by God situated in the 
    far north of the continent. The holy stigmata given to its 
    people grant their hosts with special powers, referred to
     as miracles by the people. Those with especially powerful
      miraculous powers join the glorious Knights of Holy Teachings,
       battling against the heretics who do not have holy stigmata, 
       such as beastmen or fairies. The current generation has seen 
       the births of 2 Virtuous Vestals with exceptionally powerful 
       miracles, "Ecclesia" and "Fleurdelis", leading the nation to 
       its most prosperous era yet.</p>

<p>"Dogmatika Ecclesia, the Virtuous"
    A 'Child of Miracles' who was the first person in history
     to bear the holy stigma on the forehead. Her bright smile 
     and unprejudiced personality have earned her the favor and
      admiration of the people.</p>

<p>"Dogmatika Fleurdelis, the Knighted"
    The holy stigmas on her 4 limbs grant her tremendous physical 
    strength, as well as unmatched power of thunderstrikes. Using 
    these and the 3 holy relics, this Virtuous protects both the 
    nation and "Ecclesia".</p>

<p>"Dogmatika Maximus"
    The supreme leader of "Dogmatika". He grants people the divine 
    blessing of the holy stigma using the divine sculpture "Nexus",
     before accepting them as citizens.</p>

<p>"Dogmatika Adin, the Enlightened"
    The 'Knights of Holy Teachings' are split into two companies,
     based on the legendary creatures known as 'The two dragons 
     guarding the goddess', which the divine sculpture symbolizes. 
     "Adin" is part of the support company, which offers support
      with the power of miracles.</p>

<p>"Dogmatika Theo, the Iron Punch"
    A member of the close-quarters battle company commanded by the 
    virtuous "Fleurdelis" to battle with the heretics. His iron hammer 
    is a holy tool with the ability to store power for unleashing 
    devastatingly-destructive blows.</p>
