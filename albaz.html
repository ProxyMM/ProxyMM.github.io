<h2 class="story-title-2">The Youth who Appeared in the Midst of the "Dogmatika"-"Tri-Brigade" Battle</h2>
</summary>
<p>The "Tri-Brigade" launched a rescue mission to 
    liberate their imprisoned allies from battles 
    past. They breached the holy land of "Dogmatika",
     but the 'Hole' unleashed a powerful dragon. 
     "Fleurdelis" swiftly defeated the dragon, yet 
     a wounded youth was left behind where the 
     creature vanished.</p>

     <p><img src="./Images/Albaz/9.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

     <p><img src="./Images/Albaz/11.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>A black-cloaked boy who appeared after 
    the dragon vanished. Upon witnessing 
    his deep wounds and apparent lack of 
    memories, the "Tri-Brigade" were reminded 
    of their own past, and they decided to protect him.</p>

    <p><img src="./Images/Albaz/12.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

    
<p>Acting out of pure compassion, Ecclesia shielded
     the boy, an act which caused her to be 
     denounced as a heretic who went against doctrine.</p>

 
     <p><img src="./Images/Albaz/13.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

     <p>Ashiyan lashes out at Ecclesia and conjures
         a Hole that causes her to clutch at her Stigmata, 
         apparently in great pain. The boy reacts by transforming
         into another dragon — Brigrand the Glory Dragon — and 
         repels Ashiyan while protecting the unconscious Ecclesia.
          The Tri-Brigade also jumps into action, using the
           opportunity to extradite both her and the boy from 
           the Dogmatika Nation.</p>

    Closed-Off Land</h1></summary>
<p>Gaining the protection of "Tri-Brigade", the boy and girl managed to escape their dire situation. Warning them that there will be pursuers on their trail soon, "Shuraig" told the two of them they need to quickly leave the "Tri-Brigade" stronghold. On this unfamiliar journey, the two of them began to develop a bond ever so clumsily, eventually arriving at the "Great Sand Sea" and meeting the "Springans". At first the "Springans" thought of them as enemies, but after noticing the Mecha Shrike entrusted to them by "Shuraig", they decided to give them a test to see if the boy and girl have what it takes to join them. Just as the "Springans" were about to welcome the newcomers as comrades, "Golgonda", a giant monster that haunts the "Great Sand Sea" as its nest, suddenly appeared. Possessing the same properties as the 'Hole', the energy radiating from the monster's gigantic body changed the boy into a dreadful dragon...</p>


<p><img src="./Images/Albaz/16.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 80%; height: auto;"></p>

<p>
    In a cruel twist of fate, the boy and girl had nowhere to go. Seeing the two of them reminded "Shuraig" and the others of their own past, when they were chased out by their own tribes and were on the verge of death. With no memories and incapable of trusting even himself, the young boy saw how the people before him treated even "Ecclesia", who was supposed to be their enemy, with kindness. And so, he developed his first sense of trust. Afterward, "Shuraig" entrusted the Mecha Shrike to the boy as proof of his identity.</p>
